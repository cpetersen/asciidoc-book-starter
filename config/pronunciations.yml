# Pronunciation mappings for TTS
# Format: "original phrase" => "phonetic replacement"
#
# Add new pronunciations as needed. The replacements are applied
# in order, so put longer phrases before shorter ones if they overlap.
#
# Examples:
#   "CRISPR" => "crisper"
#   "mRNA" => "messenger RNA"

pronunciations:
  # Lead (as in lead compound) vs Lead (as in lead pipe)
  "lead optimization": "leed optimization"
  "lead optimized": "leed optimized"
  "lead compound": "leed compound"
  "lead series": "leed series"
  "CD4+": "CD4-positive"
  "HER2+": "her-two-positive"

  # Acronyms that should be pronounced as words
  "ADME": "add-me"
  "IACUC": "eye-uh-cuck"

  # This is a weird one where we show the abbreviation in the text and explain the pronunciation, but use the pronunciation in audio and explain the abbreviation
  "eye-uh-cuck (pronounced \"eye-uh-cuck\")": "eye-uh-cuck (abbreviated I-A-C-U-C)"

  # Acronyms/initialisms that need specific pronunciation
  "ACT UP": "act-up"
